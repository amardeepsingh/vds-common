# Introduction

VDS.Common is a lightweight, dependency-free library of useful advanced data structures such as Trees, Tries and collision-resistant dictionaries.

It is based on code originally from in the [dotNetRDF Project][1] (see past code history [here][2] and [here][3]) but was split off into a separate library once it became sufficiently generic to be more broadly useful.

VDS.Common is built for a variety of .Net versions and profiles.
