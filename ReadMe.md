# Introduction

VDS.Common is a lightweight, dependency-free library of useful advanced data structures such as Trees, Tries and indexing tailored dictionaries.

It is based on code originally from in the [dotNetRDF Project][1] (see past code history [here][2] and [here][3]) but was split off into a separate library once it became sufficiently generic to be more broadly useful.

VDS.Common is built for a variety of .Net versions and profiles, currently we have builds for the following:

- .Net 3.5 Full/Client Profile
- .Net 4.0 Full/Client Profile
- Portable Class Library Profile 328
- .NET Core netstandard1.4

# Usage and Documentation

To use VDS.Common simply add a reference to the DLL for the appropriate .Net version to your project.  If you are using NuGet simply search for VDS.Common and install it that way.

For documentation on the features this library provides please see the [Wiki][4].
